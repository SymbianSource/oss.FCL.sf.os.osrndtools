RELEASE NOTES - ANALYZETOOL v1.9.1
RELEASED 29th April 2010

SUPPORTS SYMBIAN^1+

===============================================================================

Product Description:
====================
AnalyzeTool is a dynamic test tool that is used for testing Symbian software
for memory and resource leaks and pinpointing the leaks from the source code.

Main Features:
==============
- Pinpoints memoryleaks from target hardware and emulator to source code lines
- Discovers resource leaks from processes
- Command line interface and Carbide.c++ Extension

===============================================================================

What's New in v1.9.1
====================
- Change: Removed Avkon and Console UI's to simplify the maintenance of the
  tool
- Change: Middleware layer dependencies removed so AnalyzeTool can be now used
  also in OS layer builds
- Fix: Move all binaries to ROM instead of ROFS to avoid ROM build
  dependencies issues in hooked components

===============================================================================

Installation Notes:
===================
AnalyzeTool is typically preinstalled on ROM. If not, it can be added to the
ROM with the .iby file. Alternatively, the .sis file can be found under the sis-
directory, but the user need to sign it with their own developer certificate.
In Nokia R&D environment, you can use directly the R&D-signed .sis file under the
internal\sis directory.

When signing with own developer certificate, the following capabilities are
needed:
  ReadDeviceData
  WriteDeviceData
  DiskAdmin
  AllFiles
  SwEvent
  NetworkServices
  LocalServices
  ReadUserData
  WriteUserData
  Location
  UserEnvironment
  CommDD
  PowerMgmt
  MultimediaDD
  DRM
  TrustedUI
  ProtServ
  NetworkControl
  SurroundingsDD
  TCB

When builing AnalyzeTool against S60 3.0 or 3.1, you may need to patch your SDK
environment first with some fixes. For more information, please refer to the
instructions under the "envpatcher" directory.

System Requirements:
====================
Basic Requirements:
- Any S60 3.x device or emulator environment

===============================================================================

Compatibility Issues:
=====================
N/A

===============================================================================

Known Issues:
=============
- Kernel analysis are not supported.

- When using monitored internal data gathering mode (-mi) and hooked
  application contains huge amounts of allocations AnalyzeTool? storageserver
  might run out of memory to store the data. This message "Symbian error code
  -4" is seen when analyzing the data file with atool.exe. Solution is to use
  external / monitored external data gathering mode. 

- Switch allocator. AnalyzeTool change the application memory allocator to
  AnalyzeTool own memory allocator and using the User::SwitchAllocator function
  can lead to situation where the tested application does not work properly.
  
- AnalyzeTool hooked QT applications becomes too slow to run. Use small size
  call stack(s) and new logging mode (external -e). 

- Stif test case with AnalyzeTool can inform wrong memory leak alert.

- AnalyzeTool overwrites functions TInt User::ProcessCritical(TCritical
  aCritical) and TInt User::SetProcessCritical(TCritical aCritical), but this
  works only when the function is called from hooked exe application. So if
  setting critical is done from DLL (even if it's hooked with AnalyzeTool) the
  overwriting does not work and the process stays set critical during the
  testing.

- If hooked application is closed by calling User::Exit() from DLL instead of
  .exe application AnalyzeTool reports "abnormal process end" and can't report
  proper memory leaks.
