RELEASE NOTES - MEMSPY v2.1.0
RELEASED 15th June 2010 

SUPPORTS S60 5.0+

===============================================================================

Product Description:
====================
MemSpy is a tracing application running on an S60 device. MemSpy is typically
used to narrow down the field of investigation. Once you know where the problem
is (e.g. the thread or process), you can use other tools to perform more
detailed inspection. 

Main Features:
==============
- RAM usage of a thread or process
- Amount of stack each thread has
- Active objects for a given thread
- Files that are open in a system, or files that have been opened by a thread
- Device RAM / ROM configuration
- Servers that are running (and their sessions)
- Any memory chunks
- Heap memory changes over time
- Bitmaps loaded by the font & bitmap server

===============================================================================

What's New in v2.1.0
====================
- Feature: Folder where log files are saved can now be set in settings.
- Feature: Introduced new Orbit based user interface.
- Change: Servers, Ecom, Window groups, System info and Automatic Capture were
  removed.
- Change: Console interface was removed.
- Change: Command line interface commands were changed to be more user 
  friendly.

===============================================================================

Installation Notes:
===================
MemSpy is typically preinstalled on ROM. If not, it can be added to the
ROM with the .iby file. Alternatively, a .sis file can be found under the sis-
directory, but the user needs to sign it with their own developer certificate.
In Nokia R&D environment, you can use directly the R&D-signed .sis file under 
the internal\sis directory.

When signing with own developer certificate, the following capabilities are
needed:
  TCB
  CommDD
  PowerMgmt
  MultimediaDD
  ReadDeviceData
  WriteDeviceData
  DRM
  TrustedUI
  ProtServ
  DiskAdmin
  NetworkControl
  AllFiles
  SwEvent
  NetworkServices
  LocalServices
  ReadUserData
  WriteUserData
  Location
  SurroundingsDD
  UserEnvironment
